    <h1>Privacy Policy for ZzzCatcher</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>Golden Sphere Solutions LLC ("we", "us", or "our") operates the ZzzCatcher mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have full control over your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>ZzzCatcher requires access to your device's microphone to function. The App uses the microphone solely to record audio while you sleep in order to track and analyze snoring or other sleep sounds.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Storage and Data Security</h2>
    <p><strong>All audio recordings and analysis data are processed and stored locally on your device.</strong> We do not upload, transmit, or store your audio recordings on any external servers. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export or share a file yourself.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Because your data is stored locally on your device, we do not have access to it. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information or audio data to any third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data. You can delete individual audio recordings directly within the App. Because all data is stored locally, simply deleting the ZzzCatcher app from your device will permanently erase all associated recordings and data.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, please contact us at:<br>
